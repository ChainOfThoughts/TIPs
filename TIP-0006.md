## Abstract

This proposal provides a [foundry script](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/reference/script/) to create a new self-lending Peapods LVF pod for [$T](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x30a538effd91acefb1b12ce9bc0074ed18c9dfc9) on/using [Camelot/Algebra](https://docs.camelot.exchange/contracts/arbitrum/one-mainnet).

## Motivation

We wanted to provide an easy to follow and execute script to create a new LVF pod on peapods with all Talos-team provided configuration.

## Specification

The foundry script can be executed using the following command which creates and scaffolds all dependencies for an LVF pod in Peapods protocol:

```sh
$ forge script assets/peapods/DeployTPod.s.sol --fork-url $ARBITRUM_ONE_RPC
```

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other systems. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Security Considerations

At the time this is written we are using hardcoded configuration (fees, oracle/camelot pool, etc.) to create a new pod for $T. If changes are desired we would either need to update the configuration provided in the script or make the configuration configurable through environment variables or parameters in the script.
